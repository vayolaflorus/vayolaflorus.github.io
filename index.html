        Supporting nonprofit and public-sector teams to use technology responsibly.
      </h1>

      <p class="intro">
        If you’re responsible for programs and people, you’re likely under pressure to use more
        technology and AI — even when time, staff capacity, and support are limited.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        I support nonprofit and public-sector organizations by building staff capacity and
        supporting public-facing programs that help community members build practical digital skills.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHAT I DO -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What I do</h2>

      <p>
        I support organizations in two connected ways. Some teams need one. Many need both.
      </p>

      <div class="two-columns">
        <div class="box">
          <h3>1. Building staff capacity</h3>

          <p class="label">Who this is for</p>
          <p>
            Program managers, frontline staff, and leadership teams who are expected to use new
            digital tools or AI as part of their work.
          </p>

          <p class="label">What I support</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Practical training for staff</li>
            <li>Workshops adapted to real roles and workflows</li>
            <li>Support as teams adjust to new tools</li>
            <li>Space to slow down and ask questions</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="label">Why it matters</p>
          <p>
            When staff feel prepared, decisions feel safer and programs run more smoothly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <h3>2. Supporting public-facing programs</h3>

          <p class="label">Who this is for</p>
          <p>
            Organizations running programs that help community members build digital skills or
            access technology.
          </p>

          <p class="label">What I support</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Program design and planning</li>
            <li>Facilitating or supporting participant training</li>
            <li>Adapting content for different language levels</li>
            <li>Making sure programs work in real life</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="label">Why it matters</p>
          <p>
            Programs work better when they reflect real needs, real constraints, and real people.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
        Because I work across staff capacity and program delivery, I help organizations move from
        good intentions to real impact.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHO I WORK WITH -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who I work with</h2>

      <p>
        I work primarily with people who have responsibility for staff, programs, and outcomes,
        including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Program managers</li>
        <li>Executive directors</li>
        <li>Nonprofit leaders</li>
        <li>Development directors</li>
        <li>Public-sector teams</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        I work with nonprofit and public-sector organizations that are navigating increased pressure
        to use technology and AI responsibly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve seen how often teams are asked to adopt new tools without enough time, guidance, or
        support — and how that pressure affects both staff and the people programs are meant to serve.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach is practical and people-centered. I focus on how technology shows up in everyday
        work — in meetings, programs, classrooms, and community spaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe technology should support staff, increase access, and strengthen programs —
        not overwhelm people or create new barriers.
